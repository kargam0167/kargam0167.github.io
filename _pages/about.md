Hey there! I am Karine, a data scientist who works at the intersection of communication sciences and social psychology. I stand one foot in the academy and another in the industry.


I am currently focusing on social media and online forums as data sources for behavioral research. This is a fascinating area, given the increasing importance of online spaces in shaping our social lives and sense of self.


> Data science isn't just a profession. It's a constant learning, interpretation, and real-life application journey.

My career in the industry has the following milestones:

2012-2019: SAS  Stockholm Consumer Insights Analyst Projects: Working with analysis of large datasets and leveraging insights to multiple stakeholders, customer life cycle activities, A/B testing, and scoring.

2011-2012: SAS (Scandinavian Airlines) Eurobonus, Stockholm Key Account Manager, Loyalty & Partnerships, Working with leading brands such as American Express & MasterCard, conducting business cases & revenue analysis of loyalty solutions

My academic records show I hold an MS in Business Administration from Stockholms University and a Bachelor in International Relationships from Plekhanov Russian Economic Academy.

Returning to academia in 2019, I spent several years researching social media, collecting and understanding their metadata, and spotting trends that help us understand behavior changes. This research led to several published papers and formed my Ph.D. in Communication Sciences from the Lusofona University of Lisbon.

> Something you should know about me...

I am a mover! From the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.
