From defining patterns of consumer loyalty and building a customer database for effective communication at SAS EuroBonus to using computational methods to study human behavior and structuring the customer conversion flow of an online stock broker, my career has been built at the intersection of communication sciences, social psychology, and data science. 
Nowadays, I have been focusing on social media and online forums as data sources for the past four years. Given the increasing importance of online spaces in shaping our social lives and sense of self, this is a fascinating area of research.

I've spent much time researching social media, collecting and understanding metadata, and spotting trends that help us understand behavior changes. This research led to several published papers, which formed my Ph.D. thesis.

Mowing from the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.  


> Research isn't just a job; I love doing it. It's a constant learning, adapting, and evolving journey, fueled by curiosity and a desire to understand the interplay of culture and human experiences.
