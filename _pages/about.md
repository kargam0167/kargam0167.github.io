I am Karine Ehn, a research scientist exploring the evolving landscape of work and culture in the digital age. My interdisciplinary approach combines communication and complex systems sciences to investigate the phenomenon of digital nomadism and its impact on global work patterns.

> Researcher isn't just a profession. It's a constant journey of learning, interpretation, and real-life application.

I am studying narratives emerging in social conversations online around the neo-nomadic mobile lifestyle that became popularised following the global COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, my study identifies potential causal factors that influence neo-nomadic communities' decision-making and collective cultural dynamics. This research led to three scientific papers, forming my PhD in Communication Sciences.  

The complexity of digital nomadism's economic, social, and cultural causes may be understood through small-scale conversational interactions that give rise to population-level patterns, particularly when considering generational differences in learning styles, risk perceptions, and the impact of global events like the COVID-19 pandemic.

The first work highlights the resilience and adaptability of the digital nomad community in the face of global disruptions. We understand digital nomadism as a complex socio-economic phenomenon that continues to evolve in response to technological advancements. 

The second work extends the timeframe to the post-pandemic period and offers a complementary perspective on the community's engagement patterns and identity transformation on r/Digitalnomad.

The third paper focuses on generational differences in learning styles and risk perceptions, particularly among Gen-Z and Millennials, and studies digital nomads communications on TikTok.

> Something you should know about me...

Being a millennial myself, I embraced mobility, which has always been at the core of my life. From the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.
