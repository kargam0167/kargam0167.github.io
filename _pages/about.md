Hey there! I am Karine, and I am a data scientist. From defining patterns of consumer loyalty to studying the human behavior of an online stock broker, I have always functioned at the intersection of communication sciences, social psychology, and data science. 


Today, I am focusing on social media and online forums as data sources. Given the increasing importance of online spaces in shaping our social lives and sense of self, this is a fascinating area of research.

I've spent much time researching social media, collecting and understanding metadata, and spotting trends that help us understand behavior changes. This research led to several published papers  and formed my Ph.D. thesis.

Mowing from the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.
