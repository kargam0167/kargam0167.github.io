Hey there! I am Karine, a research scientist who works at the intersection of communication sciences and social psychology. I stand one foot in the academy and another in the industry.


I am researching social media platforms and their influence on decision-making and the collective cultural dynamics of niched communities. This is a fascinating area, given the increasing importance of online spaces in shaping our social lives and sense of self. 

Drawing upon sociology, anthropology, information theory, and complexity science concepts, the study explores how the digital culture evolves through information dissemination, adaptation, and resilience. Cultural dynamics' complex, multi-level nature is emphasised, where small-scale interactions give rise to population-level patterns. 


> Researcher isn't just a profession. It's a constant journey of learning, interpretation, and real-life application.


Returning to academia in 2019, I spent several years researching unstructured text on social media, collecting and understanding metadata, identifying research questions, and understanding how communication affects behaviour. This research led to three scientific papers, forming my PhD in Communication Sciences from the Lusofona University of Lisbon. 

My career in the industry has the following milestones:

> Something you should know about me...

I am a mover! From the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.
