I am a research scientist exploring Work Culture in the Digital Age, using a mixed methods approach to uncover this complex phenomenon. I combine introspection techniques, interviews, and computational methods such as topic modeling and sentiment analysis to capture the "what" and the "why" behind trends.

> Researcher isn't just a profession. It's a constant journey of learning, interpretation, and real-life application.

In particular, I am studying online social platforms and processes emerging on these platforms and physical co-working spaces around the mobile lifestyle. I've included some examples of my scientific work below.

> Something I am fortunate to be a part of: 

As a member of Generation X, I am one of those digital pioneers who transitioned from rotary phones to a world of mobile applications. My journey integrated significant cultural and technological shifts, weaving them into my perspective and practices.

Having witnessed five seismic tech shifts (personal computing → internet → mobile → cloud → AI) and two workplace revolutions (9-5 office culture → remote work → hybrid models), I am embracing innovations that solve concrete problems while maintaining human oversight.
