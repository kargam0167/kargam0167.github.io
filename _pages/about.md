I am a researcher; researchers fail often but see failure as just another step on the path to discovery.

My work over the last four years has been focused on my Ph.D. project, "The Future of Work," where I've looked closely at how changes in the way we communicate are reshaping society's move towards remote work and a greater sense of independence and responsibility. This area of study was a big leap from my career in analytics in fintech and the airline industry, which were very structured and command-driven. These contrasting experiences have given me a deeper insight into what makes good productivity and how organizations can work better.

I've spent a lot of time looking into social media, collecting data, and spotting trends that help us understand the changes in how we work. This research has led to several published papers and will be a key part of my Mobility and the Future of Work thesis. My personal life has been just as varied â€“ I've lived all over the world, embraced living freely without a fixed home, settled down, and become a mom. Each experience has shown me the importance of being flexible, seeing things from different perspectives, and staying true to my values even when everything around me is changing.

Research isn't just a job for me; I love to do it. I'm dedicated to learning, growing, and making a difference in the world of work and beyond. I'm a researcher at heart, forever curious and ready to discover new things. Today, I keep pushing boundaries, always ready to take on challenges that seem too tough.

My path is about embracing and assimilating the vast array of cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my own perspective and practices. It's a journey of constant learning, adapting, and evolving, fueled by curiosity and a desire to understand the complex interplay of culture in shaping human experiences and interactions. I continue mowing from the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon.

Such experiences enrich my personal and professional life, allowing me to appreciate the subtleties of cultural differences and similarities. Learning about different perceptions of time, for example, highlights how some cultures prioritize punctuality and efficiency while others value flexibility and the quality of the experience over strict adherence to the clock. Similarly, exploring ways of work reveals the spectrum from individualistic approaches, emphasizing personal achievement and autonomy, to collectivist strategies, where teamwork and community success take precedence.
