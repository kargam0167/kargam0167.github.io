Hey there! I am Karine, a research scientist who works at the intersection of communication sciences, social psychology, and data science. 


I am currently focusing on social media and online forums as data sources. Given the increasing importance of online spaces in shaping our social lives and sense of self, this is a fascinating area of research.

I've spent four years researching social media, collecting and understanding their metadata, and spotting trends that help us understand behavior changes. This research led to several published papers and formed my Ph.D. thesis in Communication Science.

> Something you should know about me...

I am a traveler! From the busy streets of Moscow to a calm and structured Stockholm and further to the creative hubs of Lisbon, my path embraces and assimilates the vast cultural nuances I encounter, weaving them into my perspective and practices.
