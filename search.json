      "content"  : "The American Express-SAS EuroBonus co-brand card is a loyalty solution that enables Scandinavian Airlines loyalty program EuroBonus members to earn points on everyday spending outside airline transactions. While the program has successfully attracted a large customer base, it faced challenges with inactive customers at risk of churning from financial products such as the American Express Payment Card. I have developed a data-driven retention initiative with colleagues to identify and re-engage at-risk customers early in their customer journey. The initiative targeted EuroBonus co-branded cardholders, leveraging predictive analytics to retain high-value customers.Photo by Nicolas Nezzo on UnsplashObjective:  create a series of targeted retention activities based on predictive analytics  enable early identification of customers likely to churn  implement tailored communication strategies to retain themMixed Methods: -Customer survey indicating the most common reasons to end the Payment Card plan (American Express)-Predictive analytics framework (Scandinavian Airlines data sources)The churn prediction model was developed using the most essential signals identified with Decision Tree modeling.
