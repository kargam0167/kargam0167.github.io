> TikTok-style videos shape how people imagine places and move through them. A hashtag network (and its clusters) can be read as a public “map of attention,” showing not only destinations but the values bundled with them—sustainability talk, housing aesthetics, self-optimization, or community care.
>
> At the macro level, use the map to visualize the distinct narratives driving global mobility. The motivation for a nomad moving to the Global South often differs entirely from one moving within the Global North or to the “Global East.”
>
> At the meso level, the visualization reveals the formation of new hubs before they appear in mainstream travel guides. We “bridge” hashtags that connect established hubs (like Bali or Lisbon) to emerging ones (like Tirana or Medellín).
>
> At the micro level, the visualization tracks the “packaging” of lifestyle, possibly by entering into an “imaginary” of it, signaled by specific visual tropes on TikTok.
