Apart from my R&D career, I have skydived for over twenty years. This "weird" activity has taught me profound lessons on risk perception and the art of being utterly present.

The R&D sector faces instability today, highlighted by significant layoffs at major Tech companies. Unemployment in Tech, thus, is a big risk. Yet, this period presents an excellent opportunity for self-investment, and there is a river of opportunities for different courses to understand the business implication of (relatively)new technology of natural language processing. This approach will likely pay off in a year or two, leading to more excellent knowledge, financial strength, and resilience. It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. As German sociologist Ulrich Beck insightfully posited:

> Risks can manifest as both threats and opportunities. The challenge and the beauty rest in our choices of engagement
