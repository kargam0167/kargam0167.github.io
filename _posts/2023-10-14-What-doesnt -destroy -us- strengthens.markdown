> TikTok-style videos shape how people imagine places and move through them. A hashtag network (and its clusters) can be read as a public “map of attention,” showing not only destinations but the values bundled with them—sustainability talk, housing aesthetics, self-optimization, or community care.
> At the macro level, use the map to visualize the distinct narratives that drive global mobility. The motivation for a nomad moving to the Global South often differs entirely from one moving within the Global North or to the "Global East"
> At the meso level, the visualization reveals the formation of new hubs before they appear in mainstream travel guides. You are looking for the "bridge" hashtags that connect established hubs (like Bali or Lisbon) to emerging ones (like Tirana or Medellin).
> At the micro level, the visualization tracks the "packaging" of lifestyle, possible buy into an "imaginary" of such lifestyle,  signaled by specific visual tropes on TikTok (e.g., "cottagecore" in the UK vs. "industrial minimalism" in Berlin).
