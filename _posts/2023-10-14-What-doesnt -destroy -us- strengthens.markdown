For the past twenty years, my free time has been devoted to skydiving, which has taught me the art of being utterly present, adaptive and resilient.

As a professional with 15 years of experience in business communications, in various roles and experiences, I have demonstrated the ability to pivot and thrive in different industries, from fintech to airlines and in various capacities, from consumer insights analysis to PhD in Communication Sciences.
I have continuously updated my skills, staying current with industry trends. My professional network spans multiple sectors and geographies, including Scandinavia and Portugal. 

I have set flexible career goals and developed strong self-awareness and emotional intelligence. I have navigated diverse roles and industries while maintaining a strong sense of purpose and direction. These qualities have enabled me to navigate complex datasets, develop algorithms for data-driven communication, analyze consumer behaviour, pursue risks, move countries, and challenge the status quo. 

> Risks can manifest as both threats and opportunities. The challenge and the beauty rest in our choices
