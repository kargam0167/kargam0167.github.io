Pursuing a Ph.D. is like an extreme mental workout—it can either grind you down or build you up, much like my two decades of skydiving. This "odd" hobby has sharpened my sense of risk and taught me to stay completely in the moment, lessons that are unexpectedly valuable in the rapidly changing world. This has occupied my mind for the past four years and has become a core of my Ph.D.

The R&D sector faces instability today, highlighted by significant layoffs at major tech companies such as Google and Amazon. Yet, this period presents an excellent opportunity for self-investment. This approach will likely pay off in a year or two, leading to greater knowledge, financial strength, and resilience. Downturns often prompt a reevaluation of personal finances, encouraging the shedding of unnecessary expenses and a general downsizing in various aspects of life. In the light of the economic downturn, it is important to remember the following:

> When actions become about making money, it distorts and destroys the initial action (Simmel 1978)

This reflection is crucial now more than ever, as the pursuit of wealth can sometimes lead to a departure from our efforts' original passion and purpose, including the noble pursuit of innovation. The impact of uncertainty is evident as long-term job security and linear career paths become relics of the past, replaced by short-term projects and a shifting allegiance from single employers to a broader quest for innovation and personal growth. 
This mirrors the larger societal shift towards a digital economy, where entrepreneurship and innovation are not just valued but are essential for survival and success.

The values and attitudes of individuals within this sector have also shifted, with a greater emphasis on innovation, flexibility, and personal fulfillment. This shift challenges the notion of work as a stable component of one's identity and life, pushing professionals to continuously adapt and reinvent themselves in response to new opportunities and challenges.

Here is the thing: the story of R&D professionals in the age of uncertainty is one of navigating with innovation and adaptability, embodying the shift from solid to liquid in their work and personal lives. It's a story of transformation, highlighting how we are moving society forward in an era where change is the only constant.
