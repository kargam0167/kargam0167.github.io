Apart from my R&D career, I have been skydiving for more than twenty years. This "weird" activity has taught me two things: profound lessons on risk perception and the art of being utterly present.

Today, the R&D sector faces instability, highlighted by significant layoffs at major Tech companies. Unemployment in Tech, thus, is a big risk. Yet, this period presents an excellent opportunity for self-investment, and there is a river of opportunities for different courses to understand the business implication of (relatively)new technology of natural language processing. This approach will likely pay off in a year or two, leading to more excellent knowledge, financial strength, and resilience. It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. As German sociologist Ulrich Beck insightfully posited:

> Risks can manifest as both threats and opportunities. The challenge and the beauty rest in our choices of engagement

The values and attitudes of individuals within this sector have also shifted, with a greater emphasis on innovation, flexibility, and personal fulfillment. This shift challenges the notion of work as a stable component of one's identity and life, pushing professionals to continuously adapt and reinvent themselves in response to new opportunities and challenges.

Here is the thing: the story of R&D professionals in the age of uncertainty is one of navigating with innovation and adaptability, embodying the shift from solid to liquid in their work and personal lives. It's a story of transformation, highlighting how we are moving society forward in an era where change is the only constant.
