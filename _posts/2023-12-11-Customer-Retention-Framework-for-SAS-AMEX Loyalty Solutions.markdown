Scandinavian Airlines loyalty program EuroBonus together with American Express issue co-brand payment cards, a loyalty solution that enables EuroBonus members to earn points on everyday spending outside airline transactions. The loyalty solution is a poplar feature amond active members, however the customer lifecycle needs constant monitoring.
Together with the American Express Customer retention team we have developed a data-driven initiative to identify and re-engage at-risk customers early in their customer journey.

Objective: 
- create a series of targeted retention activities based on predictive analytics
- enable early identification of customers likely to churn
- implement tailored communication strategies to retain them

Mixed Methods: 
- Customer survey indicating the most common reasons to end the Payment Card plan (American Express)
- Predictive analytics framework (Scandinavian Airlines data sources)

The churn prediction model was developed using the most essential signals identified with Decision Tree modeling. We used synthesized behavioral flags as early indicators, which predicted churn up to 6 months in advance. We used MS SQL for analysis of customer transactions, Azure Machine Learning for model training, Adobe Campaign for executing retention campaigns


> The brilliance is in how predictive analytics can create actionable insights

Outcomes: 
- Early identification of at-risk customers enabled timely interventions
- Enhanced customer lifetime value through personalized engagement
- The project established a scalable framework for predictive analytics in loyalty programs.
