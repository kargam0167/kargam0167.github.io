In 2011, after seven years of relentless pursuit, my dream of working at SAS, Scandinavian Airlines, finally began to materialize. Throughout these years, I had engaged in internships, applied for various roles, and even came tantalizingly close to securing a contract, only to be thwarted by the company's annual employee cut-offs. At that time, I was transitioning from a four-year stint as a consumer insight manager at Nordnet, an online stockbroker, to a new role at SEB, the second-largest private bank in Scandinavia.

The deal was sealed, and my start date at SEB was only a month away when an unexpected call from a SAS manager, who had interviewed me over the years, dramatically changed my trajectory. They were explicitly seeking me out for the position of Key Account Manager. This marked the start of my long-held dream becoming a reality, underscoring the eerie truth that sometimes, our deepest dreams have a way of manifesting themselves in the most unexpected moments.

The years that followed my arrival at SAS were a whirlwind of highs and lows, marked by daunting challenges, the looming threat of airline bankruptcy, the thrill of forging new and exciting contacts, the accumulation of a wealth of knowledge, and the challenge of navigating the often rigid hierarchical structure that characterizes the company's decision-making processes.

Working on collaborations with big names like American Express and Mastercard, I mined customer data and pushed business boundaries. I felt incredibly proud of my work and considered it the highlight of my career. However, my ambition for a closer look into the airline's tech world led me to transition into data analytics. I built the first central customer database from the fragmented transactional data sources across the whole organization.
This shift marked the beginning of a more challenging phase, contrasting sharply with the earlier successes and setting the stage for a journey through the more challenging aspects of my career. Yet, it was the tremendous learning and experiences of data politics and communication KPIs to various stakeholders. Eleven years passed like one.
