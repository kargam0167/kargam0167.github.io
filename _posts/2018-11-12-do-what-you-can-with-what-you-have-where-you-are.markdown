The American Express-SAS EuroBonus co-brand card is a loyalty solution that enables EuroBonus members to earn points on everyday spending outside airline transactions. While the program has successfully attracted a large customer base, it faced challenges with inactive customers at risk of churning. This case study outlines a data-driven retention initiative to identify and re-engage at-risk customers early in their churn journey. The initiative targeted inactive EuroBonus co-branded cardholders, leveraging predictive analytics to retain high-value customers.

Objective: To create a series of targeted retention activities based on predictive analytics, enabling early identification of customers likely to churn and implementing tailored communication strategies to retain them.

Method: The predictive analytics framework used the following data sources: flight booking patterns on SAS routes, EuroBonus point redemption frequency, and Amex card spending activity
The churn prediction model was developed using decision trees and synthesized behavioral flags (e.g., reduced point redemption or spending) as early indicators of churn, which predicted churn up to three months in advance.
Tools Used: MS SQL for database management and analysis, Azure Machine Learning for model training and deployment, Adobe Campaign for executing retention campaigns

> I have conducted predictive analytics and developed a framework for data-driven retention communication

Customer Segmentation: Segmented customers based on churn risk and behavioral traits. Conducted qualitative focus groups with selected customers to define the offer.
Created tailored communication strategies for each segment, including personalized offers such as bonus points and travel perks.

A/B Testing: Conducted A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of communication strategies:
Group A: Communication with offers (e.g., bonus points or discounts)
Group B: Communication without offers
Results varied by segment, highlighting the need for segment-specific strategies.
 

Outcomes: 1) Early identification of at-risk customers enabled timely interventions, 2) Enhanced customer lifetime value through personalized engagement, and 3) The project established a scalable framework for using predictive analytics in loyalty program management.
