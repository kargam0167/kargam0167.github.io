The American Express-SAS EuroBonus co-brand card is a loyalty solution that enables Scandinavian Airlines loyalty program EuroBonus members to earn points on everyday spending outside airline transactions. While the program has successfully attracted a large customer base, it faced challenges with inactive customers at risk of churning from financial products such as the American Express Payment Card. 
I have developed a data-driven retention initiative with colleagues to identify and re-engage at-risk customers early in their customer journey. The initiative targeted EuroBonus co-branded cardholders, leveraging predictive analytics to retain high-value customers.

Objective: 
- create a series of targeted retention activities based on predictive analytics
- enable early identification of customers likely to churn
- implement tailored communication strategies to retain them

Mixed Methods: 
-Customer survey indicating the most common reasons to end the Payment Card plan (American Express)
-Predictive analytics framework (Scandinavian Airlines data sources)


The churn prediction model was developed using the most essential signals identified with Decision Tree modeling. We used synthesized behavioral flags as early indicators, which predicted churn up to three months in advance.

Tools Used: MS SQL for analysis, Azure Machine Learning for model training, Adobe Campaign for executing retention campaigns

> I have developed a framework for data-driven retention, collected and trained the data, and conducted A/B tests to evaluate the effectiveness of communication
 

Outcomes: 
- Early identification of at-risk customers enabled timely interventions
- Enhanced customer lifetime value through personalized engagement
- The project established a scalable framework for predictive analytics in loyalty programs.
